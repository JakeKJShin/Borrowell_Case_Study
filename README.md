## **Background**
In 2014, Andrew Graham and Eva Wong co-founded Borowell with vision to help Canadians make great decisions about credit [[*1*](https://borrowell.com/who-is-borrowell)]. 
The two founders noticed that many Canadians with sound credit-card history are making unhealthy financial habits of carrying their credit card balances, paying interest at high rates due complex and long processing time in traditional lending system [[*2*](https://financialpost.com/financial-post-magazine/how-one-fintech-wants-to-save-consumers-a-lot-of-money-on-their-credit-cards)]. 
The two founders aimed to create a marketplace platform for lending where Canadians can apply and process loan applications at a much shortened timeline offering personally customized rate [[*3*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjD77npGKX8&t=415s&ab_channel=TechTO)]. 
This vision was funded CAD 5.4M by Equitable Bank and Oakwest Corporation through Seed funding and have been funded multiple times through out the years with most current funding amount of CAD 25M in Feb 2021, totalling to CAD 92M [[*4*](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/borrowell/company_financials)].

## **Lending Sector Landscape**
With abundant advancement of technology and its application in FinTech space, major developments in personal finance/lending sector has been witnessed in the past decade. One of newly observed trends is the rise of commonplaces for digital borrowers. With the rise of Gen Z, who have been familiarized with digital space, and the recent pandemic have forced borrowers to seek non-traditional lending space. This led surged use of AI and Machine learning application in the digital space. Implementation of AI and ML allowed massive data comprehension, offering personalized financial products leading to higher, more accurate approval rate for buyers with lower loss rates for lenders and shorter time to funding [[*7*](https://www.gdslink.com/5-lending-trends-for-2021/)]. 
Traditional financial instutions are also digitalizing their businesses, holding a firm position as a leader in personal lending domain whilst rising FinTech companies such as Mogo, Borrowell, and Koho are making impressive strides in the market [[*8*](https://reviewlution.ca/best/personal-loans-canada/)].

## **Impacts and Results**
Borrowell has paved a pathway for underserved subprime credit population as 53% of its members have credit score below 659 which is considered Canadian average. The company has proven record of improving credit scores of subprime credit population by 171 points in 24 months. With its recent acquisition of Refresh Financials, customer base with credit score of 500, the company has expanded its customer base and may further contribute to financial stability of its members resulting to lowering cost of borrowing, better managing budget and increasing their savings [[*9*](https://www.theimpactengine.com/bloghome/2021/2/28/borrowell-why-we-invested)]. 
The success of Borrowell may be evaluated through its # of visits, credit score improvement of its members and revenue generation. The company is recording over 1.3M visits per month, as mentioned above, was able to improve credit scores for its members and was able to generate CAD 2.1M through interest from lending and referral fees from other financial instutions when its members use the recommended financial products [[*10*](https://www.owler.com/company/borrowell), [*11*](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/borrowell/technology)].

## **Competitors**
Currently, Borrowell competes with quite well known FinTech companies such as Mogo, Koho and Credit Karma in many overlapping areas. Koho, FinTech Start-up company that is getting alot of attention has started its credit building services [[*12*](https://betakit.com/borrowell-raises-25-million-to-fund-acquisition-of-refresh-financial/)]. 
Mogo is a Vancouver based publicly traded company with over 1.6M members  offering Canadians credit score checks, identity theft monitoring, loans and mortages [[*13*](https://www.mogo.ca/about-mogo)]. 
Credit Karma, an American company that expanded to Canada offering free credit monitoring and loans are also considered strong competitor with many overlapping features [[*14*](https://borrowell.com/blog/borrowell-vs-mogo-vs-credit-karma-whats-the-difference#credit-karma)]. 

## **Recommendations**
Additional service that the company should consider is the credit fraud detection. Implementation of credit fraud detection will establish the company as the leading Fintech company in Canada, specializing in credit. According to The Canadian Bankers Association, the financial loss from credit fraud is over CAD 800M and only 19% of Canadians who were victim were aware of this [[*15*](https://www.simplerate.ca/credit-card-fraud-statistics-canada/)].
As one of the leading FinTech companies and to better establish themselves in lending sector with mission to help Canadians make great decisions about credit, they should look into developing AI tapping into Big Data to develop programs that will detect and alert the members to take necessary preventative actions [[*16*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIfDlQt6HPo&t=473s&ab_channel=AmazonWebServices)].
