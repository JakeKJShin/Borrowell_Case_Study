## **Background TEST**
In 2014, Andrew Graham and Eva Wong co-founded Borowell with vision to help Canadians make great decisions about credit [1]. The two founders noticed that many Canadians with sound credit-card history are making unhealthy financial habits of carrying their credit card balances, paying interest at high rates due complex and long processing time in traditional lending system [2]. The two founders aimed to create a marketplace platform for lending where Canadians can apply and process loan applications at a much shortened timeline offering personally customized rate [3]. This vision was funded CAD 5.4M by Equitable Bank and Oakwest Corporation through Seed funding and have been funded multiple times through out the years with most current funding amount of CAD 25M in Feb 2021, totalling to CAD 92M [4]. 

## **Expansion** 
Over the years, Borrowell has expanded its services leading innovation in lending system, attracting over 2M Canadian members. Partnering with Canada's largest credit bureau, Equifax, Borrowell offers its members speeded loan funding processes with low interest rate, free credit score checks, education on credit and Canada's first personalized credit coach, Molly, powered through Artificial Intelligence (AI) to imrpove credit. They also developed recommendation engine, analyzing each member's credit profile to make personalized financial product recommendation in their partnering financial instituions [1]. The company leverages several technologies for their business such as Impact to find and contracting with interested financial instutions and other partners, as well as Microsoft Azure for primary storage, deploying and hosting machine learning products.

## **Impacts and Results**
Borrowell has paved a pathway for underserved subprime credit population as 53% of its members have credit score below 659 which is considered Canadian average. The company has proven record of improving credit scores of subprime credit population by 171 points in 24 months. With its recent acquisition of Refresh Financials, customer base with credit score of 500, the company has expanded its customer base and may further contribute to financial stability of its members resulting to lowering cost of borrowing, better managing budget and increasing their savings [8]. The success of Borrowell may be evaluated through its # of visits, credit score improvement of its members and revenue generation. The company is recording over 1.3M visits per month, as mentioned above, was able to improve credit scores for its members and was able to generate CAD 2.1M through interest from lending and referral fees from other financial instutions when its members use the recommended financial products [9, 10].

## **Competitors**
Currently, Borrowell competes with quite well known FinTech companies such as Mogo, Koho and Credit Karma in many overlapping areas [11]. Mogo is a Vancouver based publicly traded company with over 1.6M members  offering Canadians credit score checks, identity theft monitoring, loans and mortages [12]. Koho, another FinTech Start-up that is getting alot of attention has started its credit building services [11]. Credit Karma, an American company that expanded to Canada offering free credit monitoring and loans are also considered strong competitor with many overlapping features [13]. 

## **Recommendations**
Additional service that the company should consider is the credit fraud detection. Implementation of credit fraud detection will establish the company as the leading Fintech company in Canada, specializing in credit. According to The Canadian Bankers Association, the financial loss from credit fraud is over CAD 800M and only 19% of Canadians who were victim were aware of this [14]. As one of the leading FinTech companies and to better establish themselves in lending sector with mission to help Canadians make great decisions about credit, they should look into developing AI tapping into Big Data to develop programs that will detect and alert the members to take necessary preventative actions [15].
